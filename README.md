# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Backend** is a real-world simulation of a booking platform similar to Airbnb.  
This project focuses on building a robust, scalable, and secure backend using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), providing hands-on experience in API development, database design, authentication, and deployment workflows.

## Project Goals
- Build a backend API that handles user authentication, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.
- Implement a secure and efficient JWT authentication system.
- Design a relational database schema that supports bookings, availability checks, and user roles (guest/host).
- Prepare the project for deployment using Docker and integrate a basic CI/CD pipeline.
- Develop professional skills in documentation, testing, and collaborative workflows using Git and GitHub.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Django + Django REST Framework (DRF)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL  
- **Authentication:** JWT (via `djangorestframework-simplejwt`)  
- **Deployment:** Docker, Gunicorn, Nginx  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions  
- **Optional:** GraphQL for advanced API queries

## Team Roles
- **Backend Developer:** responsible for implementing the API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic
- **Database Administrator:** manages the database design, indexing & optimisation
- **DevOps Engineer:** handles the deployment, monitoring, and scaling of digital services
- **QA Engineer:** ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughyly tested and meets the quality standards

## Technology Stack
- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework:** Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL:** Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery:** For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis:** Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
